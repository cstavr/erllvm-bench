ErLLVM Benchmark Suite
----------------------

This is a work in progress for creating the ErLLVM Benchmark Suite. If
you have any interesting benchmarks in mind don't hesitate to sent us
an email at: erllvm -at- softlab -dot- ntua -dot- gr.

Copying from `run.sh` usage:

Usage: ./run.sh options OTP_ROOT

This script runs the benchmarks using the provided OTP directory (first
non-option argument) as root and creates the corresponding diagrams.

In the OTP directory provided there should be 3 subdirectories
including complete OTP installations:
  * otp_beam: This OTP is used to run BEAM stuff and all modules are
              in BEAM.
  * otp_hipe: This OTP is used to run HiPE stuff and is has been
              compiled with --enable-native-libs.
  * otp_erllvm: This OTP is used to run ErLLVM stuff and is has been
                compiled with --enable-native-libs and [to_llvm].

OPTIONS:
  -h    Show this message
  -a    Run all available benchmarks
  -c    Benchmark class to run
  -n    Number of iterations

Examples:
  1) ./run.sh -c shootout -n 3 ~/git/otp
  2) ./run.sh -a ~/git/otp
  3) ./run.sh -a -n 5 ~/git/otp
